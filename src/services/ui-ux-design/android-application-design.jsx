                                            Android platform allows user to install any app and also use
                                            them without any restriction just because of its SDK model.
                                            The developer can debug and test the app on any device or on
                                            multiple devices without paying anything. After the testing
                                            phase is completed, we then assemble the app on the Android
                                            according to the needs of the clients.
