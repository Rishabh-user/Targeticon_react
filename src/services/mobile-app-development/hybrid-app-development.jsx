                                    Before the introduction of Android application development, Hybrid
                                    mobile apps were mainly deployed in all the mobile phones. Hybrid
                                    mobile apps are any mobile application that is built with a
                                    combination of web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and
                                    are hosted inside a native application that uses a mobile
                                    platform’s Web View. Thus the Hybrid app is covered by a thin
                                    native container that provides access to native platform features.
                                    Target Icon is such an organization who is well-trusted in the
                                    mobile application domain of the IT industry for developing Hybrid
                                    mobile apps.

                                    These Hybrid mobile apps could be found in the apps store for
                                    installing them in the mobile devices. React Native is another
                                    technology used for the development of Hybrid mobile app in Target
                                    Icon. The company ensures the implementation of the latest
                                    technologies for accomplishing the latest trends of the market.
                                    The hybrid apps are compatible with various mobile platforms.

                                            All the mobile users expect the applications to appear in a
                                            fast and glitch-free manner that can be handled conveniently
                                            like it should be instantly responsive in different devices.
                                            Hybrid mobile apps provide a responsive screen with the
                                            capability to adjust to different device screens
                                            configurations. It also solves the problem of fluctuation in
                                            data streaming. The hybrid mobile app UI is lightweight which
                                            helps in loading any content and high definition graphics.

                                            Developing a hybrid mobile application is relatively cheaper
                                            than any other web or native mobile application and also takes
                                            lesser time. As it is cost-efficient, so it plays a vital role
                                            in helping the enterprise to get their product in the market
                                            at a very less time. Thus to speed up the development process
                                            of hybrid mobile apps, the developers use various development
                                            frameworks like Xamarin, PhoneGap, etc.

                                            A hybrid mobile app provides the benefit of accessing mobile
                                            apps data at the time of poor or no internet connection. These
                                            apps store the API of the mobile to save the offline data that
                                            helps in loading the application quickly. Most of the users
                                            tend to reduce the mobile data consumption but wants to have
                                            uninterrupted access to the app’s data which is possible with
                                            the hybrid mobile apps.

                                            The hybrid apps leverage the internal programming system of
                                            the mobile through an overlay that helps in the
                                            synchronization with other compatible apps. It reduces the
                                            problem of integration and works well with the device’s native
                                            applications like camera, GPS, etc.
